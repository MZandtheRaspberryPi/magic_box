may need pull up resistors on data line or something to request 1 amp

power management IC, rechner powered, so can not short circuit

resistor in data line of led strip, less noise, less glitches

traces too thin, 6 mils is only 200 mA

ground planes good

switch by power in

electrity flows right back to power, good

thicker trace, only for LEDs

6mil is min for signal trace.

standard, 8 mil signals. then bigger for power, main power trace 1,27mm often.

capacitors, viel, 1000micro farrad. big by leds, small by usb.
