have to check clearance for acryllic over leds. the cables take up some z height i didnt plan for...

have to check clearance for acryllic on the sides. the mounting on the sides isnt too wide and i need to make sure the acryllic will fit.

usb hole is on the wrong side lol. as lights are towards the front of the box, the latch, so that when latch is open they are above.

top is fragile and easily broken. removing supports i nearly broke it. also screwing into it i caused some cracks.

screw hole size is maybe too small for the self tapping screws. i caused some cracks screwing in.

the mounts for the pcb underneath dont have enough meat on the body, they barely cover the hole for the nutt. they tore off with the support

the pcb mounts are slightly too short, so the screw pushes the led up a bit. a millimeter or two longer should help.
