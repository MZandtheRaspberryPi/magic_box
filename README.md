## Magic Box
This is a repo for a project I did. It was a magic box with leds that looks pretty that I made for friends. This repo has the CAD, electronics schematics and parts, and software, in case you want to build a MagicBox.

This project was composed of:
* Hardware
  * circuit design and implementation for the electronics and lights
  * mechanical design and implementation for how the box would fit together, hinge, and diffuse light
* Software
  * Software for the state machine to control the box and its modes
  * Software for the animations for the lights
* Design
  * Design for the box to make it look pretty in terms of materials and asthetics
  * Design for small pieces to solder weld to the top of the box, like music notes, the moon, Ganesha, and other small pieces
  
If you want to make this project I'd recommend you start with the circuit, make it on perfboard and upload the code and make sure it works. Then move on from there to printing the box.

## How Did I Build This

I started with the planning, doing some sketches and thinking through the bill of materials and the phases of this project.

### Planning


### Circuits

### Box Design
Mechanical Stuff

### Box Printing
and troubleshooting

### Assembly
Soldering lights, ect.

### Software

### Scrolling Text
This is the source for the numbers used to corespond to text letter definitions
. http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html . I used ASCII codes for lower case letters, even though the letters are uppercase when they scroll. Each letter is represented by a 5 by 3 pixel matrix. I did the matrix illustrations in the light_patterns.ods file in this repo.
