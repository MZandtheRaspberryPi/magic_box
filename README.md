## Magic Box
This is a repo that will eventually have the CAD, electronics schematics and parts, and software to build a MagicBox.

### Scrolling Text
This is the source for the numbers used to corespond to text letter definitions
. http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html . I used ASCII codes for lower case letters, even though the letters are uppercase when they scroll. Each letter is represented by a 5 by 3 pixel matrix. I did the matrix illustrations in the light_patterns.ods file in this repo.
